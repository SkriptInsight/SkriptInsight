## What is SkriptInsight

SkriptInsight is an open-source parser and a linter for Skript. It works by reading the code written by a user and analysing it to provide a rich editing experience for Skript users.

## Features

### Smart editor

### Syntax highlighting

SkriptInsight has code highlighting, but it can also highlight functions, variables (marking out the option ones) and chat colours (being rewritten on the `mc-colouring` branch). 
All color schemes (apart from minecraft chat colours) are customizable by the selected theme and we support the majority of the themes for VSCode.

### On-the-fly analysis (WIP)

Errors are shown as you type. Among others, we catch some syntax errors, invalid indentation, invalid documentation annotations.

### Highlighting

SkriptInsight highlights important parts of documentation comments, so they never look bland.

## Project delays

Since this project is being worked on my free-time and only being powered by my motivation, it will obviously take a while.
Even more so because issue #16 is a blocking issue.
